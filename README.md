Wiki Solar
======================
We made a solar system website with animation.

## Description
This is a website where a user can see all relevant information about that planet. A user can add planets and moons to the solar system. There is an animation of the planets around the sun. Any user of a planet will be added to the solar system. All of the information about planets has been pulled from the wiki api.

A user has to sign up then log in to update any information. If the user is not signed in they can not edit information. Only admins can delete any information.

We used a rails with scaffolding to create the website and using javascript for the animation using THREEjs.
